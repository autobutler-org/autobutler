#! /usr/bin/env bash

# Prepares a macOS CI runner to produce a signed App Store build:
#   1. imports the Apple Distribution certificate into a throwaway keychain
#   2. installs the App Store provisioning profile
#   3. writes an ExportOptions plist wired for manual signing
#
# Reads its inputs from the environment so nothing sensitive lands in argv or
# in the shell history of a runner log.

usage() {
    cat <<'USAGE'
Usage: scripts/ios-ci-signing.bash [--out PATH]

Prepares iOS App Store code signing on a CI runner. macOS only.

Options:
  --out PATH   Where to write the generated ExportOptions plist.
               Default: ios/ExportOptions.ci.plist
  -h, --help   Show this help.

Required environment variables:
  IOS_DIST_CERT_P12_BASE64        base64 of the Apple Distribution .p12
  IOS_DIST_CERT_PASSWORD          password protecting that .p12
  IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64 base64 of the App Store .mobileprovision

To produce the base64 values locally:
  base64 -i Certificates.p12 | pbcopy
  base64 -i Quark_App_Store.mobileprovision | pbcopy

See docs/ios-release.md for how to obtain the certificate and profile.

/// apply to them, and the handshake failure comes back as an opaque
/// `PlatformException(VideoError, ...)`.

/// Range requests are forwarded and range responses echoed back verbatim, so
/// seeking and progressive download keep working; the body is piped rather
/// than buffered, so memory stays flat regardless of file size.

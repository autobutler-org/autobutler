/// A sidebar beside a scrolling content pane on a wide window, and the same
/// sidebar stacked above that content on a narrow one.
///
/// This is the one place the sidebar breakpoint is written down. Above
/// [collapseBreakpoint] the sidebar is a fixed [sidebarWidth] pane on the
/// leading edge with a divider between it and the content. Below it the pane
/// would leave the content a sliver of screen, so the sidebar collapses into
/// the top of the content's own scroll view: scroll up and it is there, scroll
/// down and the content has the whole viewport.
///
/// The content is a sliver list rather than a widget so both layouts share one
/// scroll view, which is what lets the collapsed sidebar scroll away with the
/// content instead of stealing height from it. Handing a sliver an unbounded
/// height is also what made the photos view render nothing under 900px, so the
/// collapsed sidebar is shrink-wrapped here and never given an [Expanded]
/// (#1599).
///
/// Whether the collapsed sidebar is showing is the caller's state:
/// [isSidebarOpen] in, [onToggleSidebar] out. The widget holds no state of its
/// own, and a caller that would rather present the sidebar as a drawer or a
/// sheet passes `isSidebarOpen: false` and shows its own.
///
/// Key prefixes:
/// - `split_view_sidebar` for the sidebar pane, in either layout
/// - `split_view_toggle` for the show/hide button, rendered only when the
///   layout is collapsed and [onToggleSidebar] is supplied
